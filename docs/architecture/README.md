## Usage

Each document can be read independently or as part of the complete architecture. The sharded structure allows for:

- **Focused Reference**: Access specific architectural concerns without navigating through a large document
- **Parallel Development**: Different team members can work on different architectural aspects simultaneously
- **Version Control**: Track changes to specific architectural decisions more granularly
- **Quick Lookup**: Fast access to specific technical specifications or patterns

## Original Document

The complete, unsharded architecture document is available at [`../architecture.md`](../architecture.md) for reference.
