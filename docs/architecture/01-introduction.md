# Isntgram Fullstack Architecture Document - Introduction

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Isntgram, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project, meaning we are building it from scratch. It is a rebuild of a previous human-led project, but we will not be using an existing codebase or starter template. All configuration and tooling will be set up manually according to the standards defined in this document to ensure a clean, modern foundation.
