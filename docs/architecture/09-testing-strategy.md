# Isntgram Fullstack Architecture Document - Testing Strategy

## Testing Strategy

A strict TDD methodology with a 95%+ coverage target is required, utilizing a testing pyramid of Unit (Jest/RTL), Integration, and End-to-End (Playwright) tests.

### Testing Pyramid

1. **Unit Tests (Base)**
   - Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
   - Backend: Jest for service and utility function testing
   - Coverage target: 80%+ for unit tests

2. **Integration Tests (Middle)**
   - API endpoint testing with real database interactions
   - Component integration testing with mocked API calls
   - Coverage target: 15%+ for integration tests

3. **End-to-End Tests (Top)**
   - Playwright for critical user journey testing
   - Focus on happy paths and critical error scenarios
   - Coverage target: 5%+ for E2E tests

### Testing Tools

- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Backend Testing**: Jest + Supertest
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- **Coverage Reporting**: Built-in Jest coverage + custom reporting

### TDD Workflow

1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Repeat for each feature

### Test Organization

- Tests co-located with source code
- Shared test utilities in dedicated packages
- Mock data factories for consistent test data
- Custom Jest matchers for domain-specific assertions
