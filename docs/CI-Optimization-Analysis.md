# CI Workflow Optimization Analysis

Note: This document includes historical examples. The current pipeline builds and publishes **per-app** production
images using `apps/web/Dockerfile.prod` and `apps/api/Dockerfile.prod`.

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### **File Generation Locations (Deterministic)**

Based on `jest.config.cjs` and `scripts/coverage-report.cjs`:

#### **Coverage Files (Always Generated)**

```bash
coverage/coverage-summary.json              # Root combined coverage summary
apps/web/coverage/coverage-summary.json     # Web app coverage
apps/api/coverage/coverage-summary.json     # API coverage
```

#### **Test Results (Always Generated)**

```bash
test-results/junit/jest-junit.xml          # JUnit test results
```

#### **Build Artifacts (Always Generated)**

```bash
apps/web/.next/                            # Next.js build output
apps/api/dist/                             # NestJS build output
```

#### **E2E Test Results (Always Generated)**

```bash
playwright-report/                         # Playwright test reports
```

#### **Security Scan Results (Always Generated)**

```bash
gitleaks.sarif                             # Gitleaks security scan
```

#### **Container Security Results (Always Generated)**

```bash
sbom.xml                                   # Software Bill of Materials
```

## 🚀 **Optimization Opportunities**

### **1. Remove Conditional Coverage Logic**

**Current Problem:**

```yaml
# Current CI has complex conditional logic
if [ -f coverage-artifacts.tgz ]; then tar -xzf coverage-artifacts.tgz fi if [ -f coverage.zip ]; then unzip -o
coverage.zip fi
```

**Solution:**

```yaml
# Deterministic approach - we know exactly what files exist
tar -xzf coverage-artifacts.tgz ls -la apps/web/coverage/coverage-summary.json ls -la
apps/api/coverage/coverage-summary.json
```

### **2. Remove Redundant Development Docker Build**

**Current Problem:**

```yaml
# Builds both dev and prod images
- name: 🐳 Build Development Docker Image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  with:
    context: .
    load: true
    tags: isntgram-ai:ci

- name: 🐳 Build Production Docker Image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  with:
    context: .
    file: apps/web/Dockerfile.prod
    load: true
    tags: isntgram-ai:prod
```

**Solution:**

```yaml
# Only build production image for security scanning
- name: 🐳 Build Production Docker Image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  with:
    context: .
    file: apps/web/Dockerfile.prod
    load: true
    tags: isntgram-ai:prod
```

### **3. Remove Debug Coverage Files Step**

**Current Problem:**

```yaml
- name: 📂 Debug Coverage Files
  run: |
    echo "PWD: $(pwd)"
    ls -la
    echo "\nCoverage files found:"
    find . \( -name "coverage*.json" -o -name "lcov.info" -o -name "coverage*.xml" \) -type f |
    sed 's|^| - |'
```

**Solution:**

```yaml
- name: 📦 Extract Coverage
  run: |
    tar -xzf coverage-artifacts.tgz
    # Verify files exist at expected paths
    echo "Verifying coverage files..."
    ls -la apps/web/coverage/coverage-summary.json
    ls -la apps/api/coverage/coverage-summary.json
```

### **4. Optimize Coverage Archive Creation**

**Current Problem:**

```yaml
# Archives entire directories with potential missing files
tar -czf coverage-artifacts.tgz coverage/ apps/web/coverage apps/api/coverage 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Solution:**

```yaml
# Archive only the specific files we know exist
tar -czf coverage-artifacts.tgz \ apps/web/coverage/coverage-summary.json \ apps/api/coverage/coverage-summary.json \
coverage/coverage-summary.json
```

### **5. Remove Conditional Coverage Gate**

**Current Problem:**

```yaml
# Coverage gate runs even if no coverage files exist
coverage-gate:
  needs: [quality]
```

**Solution:**

```yaml
# Coverage gate always runs because we know coverage files are always generated
coverage-gate:
  needs: [quality]
```

## 📋 **Redundancies to Remove**

### **1. Duplicate Environment Variables**

- `NODE_ENV: test` and `CI: true` are set in multiple jobs
- **Solution:** Set globally in `env` section

### **2. Redundant Database Environment Variables**

- `DATABASE_URL` contains the same info as individual DB\_\* variables
- **Solution:** Use only `DATABASE_URL` for consistency

### **3. Unnecessary Coverage File Searching**

- Complex `find` commands to locate coverage files
- **Solution:** Use known file paths directly

### **4. Redundant Docker Builds**

- Building both dev and prod images in container-security
- **Solution:** Only build prod image for security scanning

## 🎯 **Recommended Changes**

### **1. Replace Current CI with Deterministic Version**

- Use the optimized `ci.yml` (previously `ci-deterministic.yml`)
- Removes all conditional logic and file searching
- Uses exact file paths for all operations

### **2. Update Coverage Report Script**

- Already expects exact file paths
- No changes needed

### **3. Update Jest Configuration**

- Already generates files to exact locations
- No changes needed

### **4. Remove Unused Scripts**

- Remove any scripts that search for files dynamically
- Keep only deterministic file operations

## 📈 **Expected Benefits**

### **Performance Improvements**

- **Faster CI runs** - No file searching or conditional logic
- **Reduced complexity** - Fewer if/else statements
- **Better caching** - More predictable file operations

### **Reliability Improvements**

- **No more "file not found" errors** - We know exactly where files are
- **Consistent behavior** - Same logic every time
- **Easier debugging** - Clear file paths and operations

### **Maintenance Improvements**

- **Easier to understand** - No complex conditional logic
- **Easier to modify** - Clear file path references
- **Better testing** - Can test exact file operations locally

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan**

1. **Replace current CI** with deterministic version
2. **Test locally** using our CI testing tools
3. **Verify all file paths** are correct
4. **Remove any unused conditional logic** from scripts
5. **Update documentation** to reflect deterministic approach

This approach eliminates complex file searching and conditional logic, making the CI pipeline more reliable and
maintainable.
