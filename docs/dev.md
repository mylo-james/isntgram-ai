# Development Workflow Guide

## Git Branching Strategy

### Main Branches

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features

### Feature Development

1. **Create Feature Branch**: Always branch from `develop`

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Naming Convention**:
   - `feature/` - New features
   - `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
   - `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes
   - `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

3. **Commit Messages**:

   ```
   type(scope): description

   - feat: New feature
   - fix: Bug fix
   - docs: Documentation changes
   - style: Code style changes
   - refactor: Code refactoring
   - test: Adding tests
   - chore: Maintenance tasks
   ```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating PR

1. **Update Documentation**: If your changes affect architecture, update relevant docs
2. **Write Tests**: Ensure all new code has corresponding tests
3. **Self-Review**: Review your own code before submitting
4. **Update Status**: Update project status in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`

### Creating PR

1. **Title Format**: `type: brief description`
2. **Description Template**:

   ```markdown

### PR Review Process

1. **Code Review**: At least one approval required
2. **CI/CD**: All tests must pass
3. **Documentation**: Ensure docs are updated
4. **Merge**: Squash and merge to `develop`

## Project Status Navigation

### Quick Start for New Developers

1. **Read**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current state and next steps
2. **Review**: `docs/architecture/README.md` - Technical overview
3. **Check**: `docs/prd/README.md` - Product requirements
4. **Follow**: This workflow guide

### Finding Current Progress

- **Status Dashboard**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Real-time progress
- **Epic Progress**: `docs/prd/10-epic-list.md` - High-level overview
- **Story Status**: Individual story files in `docs/stories/`

### Documentation Navigation

```

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- Git

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Isntgram-ai

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process

1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Make minimal required changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Create PR to `main`
5. After merge, cherry-pick to `develop`

### Rollback Process

1. Identify the problematic commit
2. Create rollback branch
3. Revert changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy rollback
