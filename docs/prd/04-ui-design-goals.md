# Isntgram Product Requirements Document (PRD) - User Interface Design Goals

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be a clean, modern, and intuitive high-fidelity replication of the core Instagram web
application. The primary goal is to provide a seamless and impressive experience for the target users (recruiters and
developers), faithfully replicating complex social media features with a polished feel.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

#### Infinite Scroll

The main feed will use infinite scrolling for a frictionless browsing experience.

#### Modal Dialogs

Modals will be used for key interactions such as viewing followers/following lists and uploading new posts to keep the
user within the main application context.

#### Real-time Feedback

Actions like liking a post or following a user should provide immediate visual feedback without a full page reload.

### Core Screens and Views

Based on the MVP scope, the following are the most critical views needed to deliver the core functionality:

- Login & Registration Screen
- Main Feed (Home)
- Explore Page (with Search)
- Single Post Detail Page
- User Profile Page (for self and others)
- Edit Profile Page

### Accessibility

The project will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This is a common and respected benchmark for modern web applications
and would be a strong positive signal in a portfolio piece.

### Branding

The branding for "Isntgram" should be simple, clean, and professional. It should evoke the aesthetic of a modern social
media app without directly infringing on Instagram's trademark. We will need to define a simple logo and color palette.

### Target Device and Platforms

The application must be a responsive web application that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
