# Isntgram Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Epic 5: Production Deployment & Infrastructure

## Epic 5: Production Deployment & Infrastructure

**Goal**: Establish a production-ready deployment infrastructure using Docker containers, GitHub Container Registry, and
cost-effective cloud hosting to enable reliable, scalable, and maintainable production deployments.

### Story 5.1: Docker Production Build Optimization

**As a developer**, I want optimized Docker production builds with multi-stage builds and caching, so that deployment is
fast, secure, and resource-efficient.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Multi-stage Dockerfile.prod is optimized for production with:
  - Separate build and runtime stages
  - Minimal runtime image size
  - Non-root user execution
  - Health check endpoints
  - Proper signal handling
- Docker Buildx caching is configured for faster builds
- Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities (Trivy)
- Build process includes security best practices (no secrets in images)

### Story 5.2: GitHub Container Registry Integration

**As a developer**, I want container images stored in GitHub Container Registry, so that I have a secure, private
registry integrated with my CI/CD pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) is configured for the repository
- CI pipeline builds and pushes images to GHCR on successful builds
- Images are tagged with:
  - Commit SHA for traceability
  - Latest tag for easy deployment
  - Environment-specific tags (staging, production)
- Registry access is properly secured with appropriate permissions
- Image retention policies are configured

### Story 5.3: Production Infrastructure Setup

**As a developer**, I want a cost-effective production infrastructure, so that the application can be deployed reliably
while staying within budget constraints.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Cloud provider selected (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or similar) with VM hosting
- VM specifications optimized for cost and performance
- Managed PostgreSQL database (Neon, Supabase, or similar)
- Reverse proxy with automatic SSL (Caddy or Traefik)
- DNS configuration with Cloudflare for CDN and security
- Monitoring and health check endpoints configured
- Backup strategy implemented for data and configuration

### Story 5.4: Automated Deployment Pipeline

**As a developer**, I want an automated deployment pipeline with approval gates, so that deployments are reliable and
controlled.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- CI/CD pipeline includes deployment job with environment protection
- Deployment process includes:
  - SSH connection to production server
  - Docker Compose pull and up commands
  - Health check validation
  - Rollback capability on failure
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Deployment logs and monitoring integration
- Manual approval gates for production deployments

### Story 5.5: Server Bootstrap & Configuration

**As a developer**, I want automated server setup and configuration, so that new environments can be provisioned quickly
and consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Bootstrap script for server initialization:
  - Docker and Docker Compose installation
  - User creation and SSH key configuration
  - Firewall and security hardening
  - Environment variable setup
- Docker Compose configuration for production:
  - Web and API service definitions
  - Reverse proxy configuration
  - Volume mounts for persistence
  - Network configuration
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Documentation for manual server setup

### Story 5.6: Monitoring & Observability

**As a developer**, I want monitoring and observability tools, so that I can track application health and performance in
production.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Health check endpoints implemented for all services
- Basic monitoring setup with:
  - Application logs aggregation
  - Error tracking and alerting
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Uptime monitoring
- Dashboard for viewing system status
- Alerting configuration for critical issues
- Log retention and rotation policies

### Story 5.7: Security & Compliance

**As a developer**, I want security measures implemented, so that the production environment is secure and compliant.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- SSL/TLS certificates automatically managed
- Security headers configured
- Rate limiting implemented
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security updates and patching
- Access control and authentication
- Audit logging for security events
- Compliance with basic security standards

### Story 5.8: Disaster Recovery & Backup

**As a developer**, I want disaster recovery procedures and backup systems, so that data and services can be restored in
case of failure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Automated backup strategy for:
  - Database data
  - Application configuration
  - User uploads and assets
- Backup verification and testing procedures
- Disaster recovery runbook with step-by-step procedures
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) defined
- Regular backup restoration testing

### Story 5.9: Performance Optimization

**As a developer**, I want performance optimizations implemented, so that the application provides fast and responsive
user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- CDN configuration for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies implemented
- Image optimization and compression
- Load balancing considerations
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Optimization recommendations and implementation

### Story 5.10: Documentation & Runbooks

**As a developer**, I want comprehensive documentation and runbooks, so that the deployment and operations processes are
well-documented and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Deployment runbook with step-by-step procedures
- Rollback procedures documented
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Infrastructure as code documentation
- API documentation and integration guides
- Security incident response procedures
- Change management procedures
- Knowledge transfer documentation for team members
