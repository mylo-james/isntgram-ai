# Isntgram Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Goals and Background

## Goals

1. To successfully build and deploy a feature-complete "Isntgram" application that mirrors the capabilities of the original human-led version.

2. To create a comprehensive set of documentation (Project Brief, PRD, Architecture, "Making Of" narrative) that clearly showcases the AI-driven development process.

3. To demonstrate mastery of the BMad-Method and AI agent orchestration, creating a standout portfolio piece.

## Background Context

The software development landscape is undergoing a significant shift towards AI-assisted and AI-driven workflows. This project addresses the need for developers to demonstrate proficiency not just in coding, but in orchestrating these modern, AI-centric processes.

Instead of just presenting a final product, the "Isntgram" rebuild will showcase the process of creation itself as a primary deliverable. By leveraging the BMad-Method's team of specialized AI agents, this project will serve as a detailed case study, providing tangible proof of expertise in guiding an AI-powered team to produce a high-quality, complex application.
