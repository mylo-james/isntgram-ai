# Mylo Todo - GitHub Blockers for Story 1.2

## GitHub Actions CI Pipeline Blockers

### Task 4: Create GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

The following items require GitHub repository access or settings that I cannot configure:

1. **Repository Secrets** - May need to configure:
   - NPM_TOKEN (if using private packages)
   - Any database connection strings for integration tests
   - API keys for external services

2. **Branch Protection Rules** - Recommend configuring:
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Require review from code owners

3. **GitHub Actions Permissions** - Verify:
   - Repository has Actions enabled
   - Workflow permissions are set correctly
   - GITHUB_TOKEN has necessary permissions

4. **Repository Settings** - Consider:
   - Enable "Automatically delete head branches" for cleaner PR workflow
   - Configure merge strategies (squash, rebase, merge)

### Task 5: Coverage Reporting Blockers

1. **Coverage Badges** - Requires:
   - GitHub repository to be public OR
   - Third-party service integration (Codecov, Coveralls)
   - Badge URL configuration

## Implementation Notes

- I can create the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with standard configuration
- The CI pipeline should work immediately once pushed to GitHub
- All other testing infrastructure can be implemented without GitHub access
- Tests will run locally and should pass before pushing to trigger CI

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. Push the CI configuration to GitHub
2. Verify the workflow runs successfully
3. Configure any necessary repository secrets
4. Set up branch protection rules
5. Test the full CI/CD pipeline with a sample PR

## Status

- ✅ Can implement: All testing frameworks and local test execution
- ⚠️ Requires GitHub access: CI pipeline configuration and repository settings
- ⚠️ May require external services: Coverage badges and reporting
