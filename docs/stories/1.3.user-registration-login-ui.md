# Story 1.3: User Registration & Login UI

**Status**: Completed

## Story

**As a new user**, I want to see and interact with registration and login forms, so that I can create an account or sign
in to the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `/register` page displays a form with fields for email, full name, username, and password.
2. A `/login` page displays a form with fields for email and password.
3. The forms have basic client-side validation (e.g., valid email format, password meets minimum complexity).
4. The forms are styled with Tailwind CSS to match the modern, clean aesthetic.
5. Form submission is wired to placeholder functions; direct API integration is not required in this story.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2 completion:

- Jest and React Testing Library are properly configured for frontend testing
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced with ESLint rules
- Test files should be co-located with source code using `.test.tsx` pattern
- Pre-commit hooks include ESLint and Markdownlint for code quality

### Data Models

**User Interface** [Source: packages/shared-types/src/auth.ts]:

```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName?: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
  bio?: string;
  isVerified: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt?: Date;
}
```

**Note**: There's a discrepancy between architecture data models (uses `fullName`) and existing shared types (uses
`firstName`/`lastName`). For this story, use the existing shared types structure.

### API Specifications

No API integration required for this story - forms should use placeholder functions that log form data to console
[Source: docs/prd/06-epic-1-foundation.md#story-1.3].

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- Feature-sliced component organization
- Modern component template with styling defined after component logic
- Next.js App Router for file-system-based routing
- Centralized API client services layer (for future stories)

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- Pages: `apps/web/app/[route]/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router)
- Components: `apps/web/components/ui/` for reusable UI components
- Utilities: `apps/web/lib/` for validation and other utilities
- Tests: Co-located with source files using `.test.tsx` extension

### Technical Constraints

**TypeScript Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md]:

- Strict Mode: All TypeScript strict flags enabled
- Shared Types: Use types from `packages/shared-types` for consistency
- No `any`: Explicit typing required
- Interface over Type: Prefer interfaces for object shapes

**Code Organization** [Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md]:

- Feature-Sliced Architecture: Organize by feature rather than technical concerns
- Co-location: Tests, types, and utilities co-located with source code
- Barrel Exports: Use index files for clean imports

**Immutability** [Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md]:

- No Direct Mutations: Avoid direct object/array mutations
- Immutable Updates: Use spread operators
- Functional Programming: Prefer pure functions where possible

### Testing Standards

**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/09-testing-strategy.md]:

- Unit Tests: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Coverage target: 80%+ for unit tests
- Tests co-located with source code
- TDD Workflow: Write failing test first, implement minimal code, refactor

**Specific Requirements**:

- All form components must have unit tests
- Test validation logic thoroughly
- Test error states and user interactions
- Mock form submission handlers in tests

### Tech Stack

**Frontend** [Source: docs/architecture/02-high-level-architecture.md]:

- Next.js with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Auth.js for authentication (future integration)
