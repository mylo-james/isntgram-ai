# Story 1.5: Frontend-Backend Authentication Integration

**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a user**, I want to submit the registration and login forms and be securely authenticated, so that I can access the
application's protected features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The frontend registration form successfully calls the backend API, creating a user.
2. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the login page with a success message.
3. The login form successfully authenticates the user via the backend.
4. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the main feed, and their session state is managed globally (e.g., in
   Redux).
5. A "Sign Out" mechanism is implemented that clears the session and redirects to the login page.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.4 completed backend authentication with Auth.js integration and comprehensive error handling [Source:
  docs/stories/1.4.user-authentication-backend.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Backend registration endpoint at POST /api/auth/register with bcrypt password hashing implemented
- Auth.js configured with credential provider and secure session management
- Global exception filter and rate limiting (10 requests/minute) implemented
- Comprehensive test suite with 25+ passing tests covering all authentication scenarios

### Data Models

**User Interface** [Source: docs/architecture/04-data-models.md#User]:

```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  fullName: string;
  email: string;
  profilePictureUrl?: string;
  bio?: string;
  postsCount: number;
  followerCount: number;
  followingCount: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Registration DTO** [Source: docs/stories/1.4.user-authentication-backend.md#Dev Notes]:

```typescript
export class RegisterDto {
  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsString()
  @MinLength(3)
  @MaxLength(30)
  username: string;

  @IsString()
  @MinLength(2)
  @MaxLength(100)
  fullName: string;

  @IsString()
  @MinLength(8)
  password: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Authentication Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture/05-api-specification.md]:

- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with validation
- Auth.js handles login/logout automatically at `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- Session management via Auth.js session provider

**Error Response Format** [Source: docs/stories/1.4.user-authentication-backend.md#Dev Notes]:

```typescript
{
  statusCode: number;
  message: string;
  error: string;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### Component Specifications

**Form Components** [Source: docs/stories/1.3.user-registration-login-ui.md#Dev Notes]:

- Registration form with email, fullName, username, password fields
- Login form with email and password fields
- Client-side validation using `apps/web/lib/validation.ts`
- Tailwind CSS styling with modern design patterns
- Error display components for form validation

**Protected Route Pattern** [Source: docs/architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- Use Next.js App Router for file-system-based routing
- Implement route protection with Auth.js session validation
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- Loading states during authentication checks

### File Locations

- `apps/web/test/auth.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/09-testing-strategy.md]:

- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for critical user journey testing
- **Test Organization**: Tests co-located with source code
- **Coverage Target**: 95%+ overall test coverage following TDD methodology

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:

- Test API client error handling and request/response interceptors
- Test form submission flows with loading states and error scenarios
- Test Redux state management for authentication
- Test route protection and session validation
- Test sign out functionality and session clearing
- Test integration between Auth.js and Redux state management

### Technical Constraints

**State Management** [Source: docs/architecture/03-development-environment.md]:

- Redux Toolkit for global state management (explicitly required by PRD)
- Auth.js session provider for authentication state
- Integration between Redux and Auth.js session management

**Error Handling** [Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md]:

- Global exception filter for consistent error responses
- API client interceptor for error handling
- User-friendly error messages for all authentication scenarios
- Proper error logging for debugging

**TypeScript Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md]:

- Strict mode enabled with no implicit any types
- Use shared types from `packages/shared-types` for consistency
- Explicit typing required for all API responses and state

### Project Structure Notes

The frontend architecture follows feature-sliced organization with:

- Components co-located with their tests
- Shared utilities in `apps/web/lib/` directory
- Redux store organized by feature slices
- API client centralized for consistent HTTP handling
