# Story 2.3: Profile Follower/Following Stats

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a user**, I want to see the number of followers a user has and the number of users they are following on their
profile page, so that I can understand their social context within the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The backend API that serves user profile data now includes accurate counts for followers and following.
2. The user profile UI accurately displays the "followers" count.
3. The user profile UI accurately displays the "following" count.
4. These counts update correctly after I follow or unfollow a user (a page refresh is an acceptable way to see the
   update for this story).

  - [ ] Add loading states for when counts are being fetched

- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate Stats with Profile Page** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Update `apps/web/app/[username]/components/ProfileHeader.tsx` to include ProfileStats
  - [ ] Pass user data with counts to ProfileStats component
  - [ ] Handle loading and error states for stats display
  - [ ] Ensure stats are properly positioned in profile layout
  - [ ] Add proper spacing and styling integration

- [ ] **Task 5: Update Frontend Data Fetching** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update `apps/web/lib/api-client.ts` to handle new count fields
  - [ ] Update Redux store to include follower/following counts
  - [ ] Ensure profile data is refreshed after follow/unfollow actions
  - [ ] Add proper error handling for count fetching
  - [ ] Implement optimistic updates for better UX

- [ ] **Task 6: Create Comprehensive Tests** (Testing Requirements)
  - [ ] Create `apps/web/components/profile/ProfileStats.test.tsx` with unit tests
  - [ ] Test count display and formatting
  - [ ] Test loading and error states
  - [ ] Create backend tests for count calculation in `apps/api/src/users/users.service.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test API endpoints with count data in `apps/api/test/users.integration.test.ts`
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for profile stats display
  - [ ] Ensure 80%+ test coverage for new code

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.1 (Follow/Unfollow Backend Logic) provides the follows table and relationships
- Story 2.2 (Frontend Follow/Unfollow Integration) provides the follow button functionality
- User profile page already implemented with dynamic routing
- Authentication system fully functional with Auth.js integration
- Redux store configured for user state management

### Data Models

**User Profile with Counts** [Source: architecture/04-data-models.md#user]:

```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  fullName: string;
  email: string;
  profilePictureUrl?: string;
  bio?: string;
  postsCount: number;
  followerCount: number; // New field
  followingCount: number; // New field
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Profile Stats Component Props**:

```typescript
interface ProfileStatsProps {
  followerCount: number;
  followingCount: number;
  postsCount: number;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Updated User Profile Endpoint** [Source: architecture/05-api-specification.md]:

- `GET /api/users/{username}` - Get user profile with follower/following counts
- Response includes `followerCount` and `followingCount` fields
- Counts are calculated in real-time from follows table

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- Backend Controller: `apps/api/src/users/users.controller.ts`
- Backend Service: `apps/api/src/users/users.service.ts`
- User Entity: `apps/api/src/users/entities/user.entity.ts`
- Frontend Component: `apps/web/components/profile/ProfileStats.tsx`
- Profile Integration: `apps/web/app/[username]/components/ProfileHeader.tsx`
- API Client: `apps/web/lib/api-client.ts`
- Shared Types: `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`
- Tests: `apps/web/components/profile/ProfileStats.test.tsx`
- Backend Tests: `apps/api/src/users/users.service.test.ts`

### Technical Constraints

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/07-database-schema.md]:

- PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- Denormalized counts for performance optimization
- Follows table with proper indexing for count queries
- Foreign key constraints to users table

**Backend Architecture** [Source: architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- NestJS with feature-based modular structure
- Repository Pattern using TypeORM
- JWT-based authentication strategy
- Global exception filter for consistent error responses

**Frontend Architecture** [Source: architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- Next.js App Router for file-system-based routing
- Redux Toolkit for global state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Centralized API client services layer

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/10-coding-standards.md]:

- TypeScript strict mode with no implicit any
- Use shared types from `packages/shared-types`
- JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Immutable updates, no direct mutations
- Co-located tests with source code

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/09-testing-strategy.md]:

- TDD methodology with 95%+ coverage target
- Unit tests: Jest for service and component testing (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests: API endpoint testing with real database (15%+ coverage)
- E2E tests: Playwright for critical user journey testing (5%+ coverage)

**Test Organization**:

- Unit tests: `apps/web/components/profile/ProfileStats.test.tsx`
- Backend tests: `apps/api/src/users/users.service.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/test/users.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `e2e/profile-stats.test.ts`

### Key Dependencies

- TypeORM for database operations and count queries
- NestJS for backend API development
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shared types from `packages/shared-types`

## Testing

- Unit tests for ProfileStats component with 80%+ coverage
- Backend tests for count calculation logic
- Integration tests for user profile endpoints with counts
- E2E tests with Playwright for profile stats display
- Test count accuracy and real-time updates
- Test loading states and error handling
- Follow TDD methodology: write failing test first, implement minimal code, refactor
