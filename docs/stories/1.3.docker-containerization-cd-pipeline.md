# Story 1.3: Docker Containerization & CD Pipeline

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a developer**, I want Docker containers and a continuous delivery pipeline configured, so that the application can
be reliably deployed to production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Multi-stage Dockerfile.prod is created for optimized production builds.
2. Docker Compose configuration for local development and production orchestration.
3. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) integration for storing container images.
4. CI/CD pipeline includes:
   - Building and pushing Docker images to GHCR on successful CI
   - Image tagging with commit SHA and latest tags
   - Docker Buildx caching for faster builds
   - Automated deployment job with environment approval gates
   - Health check validation for deployment success
5. Bootstrap scripts for server setup and deployment automation.
6. Documentation for deployment procedures, rollback processes, and infrastructure management.
