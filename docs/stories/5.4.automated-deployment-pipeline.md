# Story 5.4: Automated Deployment Pipeline

**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a developer**, I want an automated deployment pipeline with approval gates, so that deployments are reliable and
controlled.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CI/CD pipeline includes deployment job with environment protection
2. Deployment process includes:
   - SSH connection to production server
   - Docker Compose pull and up commands
   - Health check validation
   - Rollback capability on failure
3. Environment-specific configuration management
4. Deployment logs and monitoring integration
5. Manual approval gates for production deployments

  - [ ] Add configuration backup and restore procedures

- [ ] **Task 5: Add Deployment Monitoring** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Integrate deployment logs with monitoring system
  - [ ] Add deployment success/failure notifications
  - [ ] Implement deployment metrics and tracking
  - [ ] Configure deployment health monitoring
  - [ ] Add deployment performance analytics

- [ ] **Task 6: Create Deployment Scripts** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create deployment automation scripts
  - [ ] Add pre-deployment validation checks
  - [ ] Implement post-deployment verification
  - [ ] Add deployment cleanup procedures
  - [ ] Configure deployment logging and audit trails

- [ ] **Task 7: Add Security and Compliance** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Implement deployment security scanning
  - [ ] Add deployment audit logging
  - [ ] Configure deployment access controls
  - [ ] Add compliance checks and reporting
  - [ ] Implement deployment security best practices

- [ ] **Task 8: Create Deployment Documentation** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Document deployment procedures and workflows
  - [ ] Create rollback procedures and runbooks
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guides for deployment issues
  - [ ] Document configuration management procedures
  - [ ] Create deployment monitoring and alerting guide

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 5.1 (Docker Production Build Optimization) provides optimized containers
- Story 5.2 (GHCR Integration) provides container registry
- Story 5.3 (Production Infrastructure) provides target infrastructure
- Current CI/CD pipeline includes basic testing and building
- Current test coverage: 30/30 suites passing across web/api/shared

### Technical Requirements

**Deployment Pipeline** [Source: architecture/13-deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- Environment-specific configurations
- Health check validation and monitoring
- Deployment logging and audit trails

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/08-project-structure.md]:

- CI/CD Config: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Deployment Scripts: `scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/rollback.sh`
- Environment Config: `config/environments/`
- Documentation: `docs/deployment/pipeline.md`

### Technical Constraints
