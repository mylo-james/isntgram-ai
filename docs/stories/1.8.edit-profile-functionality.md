# Story 1.8: Edit Profile Functionality

**Status**: Completed

## Story

**As a logged-in user**, I want to edit my profile information, so that I can keep my details up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking the "Edit Profile" button opens a modal or navigates to an edit page containing fields for my full name and
   username.
2. The form is pre-populated with my current data.
3. The form has validation to prevent submitting empty fields or a username that is already taken.
4. Submitting the form successfully updates the user's information in the database.
5. The profile page reflects the updated information upon successful submission.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.7 completed basic user profile page with dynamic routing
- User profile data fetching and display implemented
- Authentication-based UI differences (edit vs follow button) established
- Profile page error handling and 404 states implemented

### Data Models

**Profile Update DTO**:

```typescript
export interface UpdateProfileDto {
  fullName: string;
  username: string;
}

export interface ProfileUpdateResponse {
  success: boolean;
  user: UserProfile;
  message?: string;
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update current user's profile
- `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user's profile data
- `GET /api/users/check-username/[username]` - Check username availability

### Key Dependencies

- React Hook Form for form management and validation
- Redux for global state management
- Auth.js for user session and authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Testing Library for component testing

## Testing

- Unit tests for edit profile modal and form validation
- Integration tests for profile update API
- E2E tests with Playwright for complete edit profile flow
- Test coverage requirements: 80% for new code
- Test form validation, submission, and error scenarios

### Debug Log References

- 2025-08-10: Created `EditProfileModal` with accessibility (Escape to close, focus trap entry, overlay click), fields
  for full name and username, and integrated into `ProfileActions` opening modal instead of navigating away
- 2025-08-10: Added unit tests `EditProfileModal.test.tsx` covering render, pre-population, close behaviors, and submit
  callback; updated to async submit with React Hook Form
- 2025-08-10: Implemented `GET /users/me`, `GET /users/check-username/:username`, `PUT /users/profile`; DTO validation;
  service methods for uniqueness; controller and service tests; users integration test
- 2025-08-10: Updated `ProfileActions` to prefetch current data, validate username, submit updates, dispatch Redux
  update, and refresh UI/route; suppressed noisy console.error logs in web Jest setup
- 2025-08-10: All tests passing (web/api/root) and types OK

### Completion Notes List

- ✅ Full edit profile flow implemented end-to-end
- ✅ Robust validation and username uniqueness with backend check
- ✅ Smooth UX with pre-population, loading, and optimistic updates; Redux reflects changes
