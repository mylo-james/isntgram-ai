# Story 5.3: Production Infrastructure Setup

**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a developer**, I want a cost-effective production infrastructure, so that the application can be deployed reliably
while staying within budget constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Cloud provider selected (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or similar) with VM hosting
2. VM specifications optimized for cost and performance
3. Managed PostgreSQL database (Neon, Supabase, or similar)
4. Reverse proxy with automatic SSL (Caddy or Traefik)
5. DNS configuration with Cloudflare for CDN and security
6. Monitoring and health check endpoints configured
7. Backup strategy implemented for data and configuration
