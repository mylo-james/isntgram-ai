# Story 2.4: Followers/Following List Modal

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a user**, I want to click on the follower/following stats on a profile page to see a list of those users, so that I
can discover new people.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking the "followers" count on a profile opens a modal dialog.
2. The modal displays a scrollable list of all users who follow the profile's owner.
3. Clicking the "following" count on a profile opens a similar modal displaying a list of all users the profile's owner
   is following.
4. Each user in the list displays their profile picture, username, and full name.
5. Clicking on a user in the modal navigates to their respective profile page.
6. A "Follow" / "Following" button is displayed next to each user in the list (except for myself), and it is fully
   functional.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.1 (Follow/Unfollow Backend Logic) provides the follows table and relationships
- Story 2.2 (Frontend Follow/Unfollow Integration) provides the FollowButton component
- Story 2.3 (Profile Follower/Following Stats) provides the ProfileStats component
- User profile page already implemented with dynamic routing
- Authentication system fully functional with Auth.js integration
- Redux store configured for user state management

### Data Models

**Followers/Following Response** [Based on architecture patterns]:

```typescript
interface FollowersResponse {
  users: Array<{
    id: string;
    username: string;
    fullName: string;
    profilePictureUrl?: string;
    isFollowing: boolean;
  }>;
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    hasMore: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Modal Component Props**:

```typescript
interface FollowersModalProps {
  username: string;
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  followerCount: number;
}

interface FollowingModalProps {
  username: string;
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  followingCount: number;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Followers/Following Endpoints** [Source: architecture/05-api-specification.md]:

- `GET /api/users/{username}/followers` - Get list of user's followers with pagination
- `GET /api/users/{username}/following` - Get list of users being followed with pagination
- Both endpoints require authentication and return paginated user lists
- Include current user's follow status for each user in the list
