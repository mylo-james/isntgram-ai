# Story 5.2: GitHub Container Registry Integration

**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a developer**, I want container images stored in GitHub Container Registry, so that I have a secure, private
registry integrated with my CI/CD pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) is configured for the repository
2. CI pipeline builds and pushes images to GHCR on successful builds
3. Images are tagged with:
   - Commit SHA for traceability
   - Latest tag for easy deployment
   - Environment-specific tags (staging, production)
4. Registry access is properly secured with appropriate permissions
5. Image retention policies are configured

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Configure GHCR Repository** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up GitHub Container Registry for the repository
  - [ ] Configure repository permissions and visibility
  - [ ] Set up package access controls
  - [ ] Configure image retention policies
  - [ ] Add repository documentation

- [ ] **Task 2: Update CI/CD Pipeline** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add GHCR authentication to GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Configure Docker login to GHCR
  - [ ] Add image build and push steps
  - [ ] Implement conditional builds (main branch only)
  - [ ] Add build failure handling

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Image Tagging Strategy** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add commit SHA tagging for traceability
  - [ ] Add latest tag for easy deployment
  - [ ] Add environment-specific tags (staging, production)
  - [ ] Implement semantic versioning tags
  - [ ] Add tag validation and cleanup

- [ ] **Task 4: Configure Security and Permissions** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up repository secrets for GHCR access
  - [ ] Configure least privilege access controls
  - [ ] Implement image signing and verification
  - [ ] Add security scanning integration
  - [ ] Configure access audit logging

- [ ] **Task 5: Add Image Retention Policies** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Configure automatic image cleanup
  - [ ] Set retention periods for different tag types
  - [ ] Implement manual cleanup procedures
  - [ ] Add retention policy documentation
  - [ ] Configure cleanup notifications

- [ ] **Task 6: Create Deployment Integration** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Update deployment scripts to pull from GHCR
  - [ ] Add image verification in deployment
  - [ ] Implement rollback image selection
  - [ ] Add deployment image tracking
  - [ ] Configure deployment notifications

- [ ] **Task 7: Add Monitoring and Alerting** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Set up image build monitoring
  - [ ] Add registry usage monitoring
  - [ ] Configure build failure alerts
  - [ ] Add image security alerts
  - [ ] Implement registry health checks

- [ ] **Task 8: Create Documentation** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Document GHCR setup and configuration
  - [ ] Create image tagging strategy guide
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting procedures
  - [ ] Document security best practices
  - [ ] Create registry management runbook
