# Story 5.1: Docker Production Build Optimization

**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a developer**, I want optimized Docker production builds with multi-stage builds and caching, so that deployment is
fast, secure, and resource-efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Multi-stage Dockerfile.prod is optimized for production with:
   - Separate build and runtime stages
   - Minimal runtime image size
   - Non-root user execution
   - Health check endpoints
   - Proper signal handling
2. Docker Buildx caching is configured for faster builds
3. Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities (Trivy)
4. Build process includes security best practices (no secrets in images)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Epic 1 (Foundation) provides the basic Docker setup
- Current CI/CD pipeline includes basic Docker builds
- Development environment uses Docker Compose
- Current test coverage: 30/30 suites passing across web/api/shared

### Technical Requirements

**Docker Optimization** [Source: architecture/13-deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- Multi-stage builds for minimal runtime images
- Layer caching for faster rebuilds
