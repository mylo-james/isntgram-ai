# Story 1.2: TDD Test Harness & CI Pipeline Setup

**Status**: Complete

## Story

**As a developer**, I want a complete testing harness (unit, integration, E2E) and a basic CI pipeline configured, so
that I can practice TDD from the very beginning and ensure code quality automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Jest and React Testing Library are configured for the Next.js frontend.
2. Jest is configured for the NestJS backend.
3. An E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) is installed and configured.
4. A basic CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is created that installs dependencies and runs all tests on every
   push to the main branch.
5. A sample passing unit test exists in both the frontend and backend to prove the configuration.
6. The CI pipeline runs successfully on the initial commit.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- Jest and RTL are already configured for the frontend (apps/web)
- Jest is already configured for the backend (apps/api)
- Sample tests exist: app/page.test.tsx (frontend) and src/app.controller.test.ts (backend)
- Testing frameworks are working with passing tests
- Monorepo structure is established with npm workspaces

### Testing Strategy Requirements

**Testing Pyramid Structure** [Source: architecture/09-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:

- Unit Tests (Base): 80%+ coverage target using Jest + React Testing Library (frontend) and Jest (backend)
- Integration Tests (Middle): 15%+ coverage target with API endpoint testing and real database interactions
- End-to-End Tests (Top): 5%+ coverage target using Playwright for critical user journeys

**Testing Tools** [Source: architecture/09-testing-strategy.md#testing-tools]:

- Frontend Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- E2E Testing: Playwright (not Cypress as mentioned in AC)
- Coverage Reporting: Built-in Jest coverage + custom reporting

**TDD Workflow** [Source: architecture/09-testing-strategy.md#tdd-workflow]:

1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Repeat for each feature

**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/09-testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:

- Tests co-located with source code
- Shared test utilities in dedicated packages
- Mock data factories for consistent test data
- Custom Jest matchers for domain-specific assertions

### Technology Stack Requirements

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/03-development-environment.md#technology-stack-table]:

- Frontend Testing: Jest & RTL (latest versions) for unit and integration testing
- Backend Testing: Jest (latest) for unit and integration testing
- E2E Testing: Playwright (~1.x) for end-to-end testing of critical user flows
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment pipelines

### Project Structure Requirements

**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/08-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]:

- Frontend tests in apps/web including a dedicated tests directory
- Backend tests co-located with source in apps/api
- Tests follow feature-sliced organization
- Shared test utilities can be placed in packages/

**CI/CD Pipeline** [Source: architecture/08-project-structure.md#deployment-architecture]:

- GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and building
- Pipeline should run on pushes to main branch
- Must integrate with monorepo structure

### Coding Standards for Tests

**TypeScript Standards** [Source: architecture/10-coding-standards.md#typescript-standards]:

- All TypeScript strict flags enabled for test files
- Use shared types from packages/shared-types for consistency
- No implicit any types in tests
- Prefer interfaces for test object shapes

**Code Organization** [Source: architecture/10-coding-standards.md#code-organization]:

- Tests co-located with source code
- Use barrel exports for clean test utility imports
- Follow consistent naming conventions for test files (\*.test.ts pattern)

### File Locations and Structure

Based on existing project structure from Story 1.1:

- Frontend tests: `apps/web/**/*.test.tsx` and `apps/web/tests/` directory
- Backend tests: `apps/api/src/**/*.test.ts` and `apps/api/test/` directory
- E2E tests: Root level `tests/` or `e2e/` directory
- CI configuration: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Shared test utilities: `packages/shared-types/src/test-utils/` or dedicated test package

### Testing

**Test File Naming** [Source: architecture/10-coding-standards.md#code-organization]:

- Frontend: `*.test.tsx` for React component tests
- Backend: `*.test.ts` for service and controller tests
- E2E: `*.spec.ts` for Playwright tests

**Coverage Targets** [Source: architecture/09-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:

- Overall target: 95%+ coverage
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests: 15%+ coverage
- E2E tests: 5%+ coverage

**Test Standards**:

- All tests must follow TDD methodology
- Tests co-located with source code
- Use shared test utilities and mock data factories
- Custom Jest matchers for domain-specific assertions
- Proper error handling and user-friendly test failure messages
